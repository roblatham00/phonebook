===========================

This project is a template to start developing a Mochi microservice based on Margo.
The complete documentation to get started using this template is available
[here](https://mochi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates/01_margo.html).

To use this template:
- Click on the green "Use this template" button at the top.
- Give a name to your project.
- Once your project repository is created, go to Settings > Actions > General and give "Read and write permissions" under *Workflow permissions*.
- Finally, edit the initial-setup.json file and push the changes to your repo.

Editing the initial-setup.json file with trigger a github action that will
cleanup your repository and rename files, namespaces, functions, etc. according
to the name of your service and the resources it manages.

Enjoy working with Mochi!
